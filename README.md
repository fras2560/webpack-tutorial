## TLDR
`npm install`
`npm start`
should open a browser in chrome with some text and making any changes in an editor should be reflected upon save

## Walkthrough
This is my notes from going through a webpack tutorial. I used the following tutorial as a starting point but adjusted it to not use react. https://www.valentinog.com/blog/babel/

There is some dependencies we need to install before starting


```npm init -y
npm i webpack --save-dev
npm i webpack-cli --save-dev```

Now will need to tell npm to use webpack when building. Need to add the scripts attribute in the file _package.json_
```
"scripts": {
 "build": "webpack --mode production"
}
```

Now at this point can define a minimal webpack configuration. Create a file named _webpack.config.js_ and fill in the following:
```
module.exports = {
 module: {
   rules: [
     {
       test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
       exclude: /node_modules/,
       use: {
         loader: "babel-loader"
       }
     }
   ]
 }
};
```

The babel load is what enables Webpack to support older browsers such as IE. The code will get transpiled into ES2015 code. So will need the dependency :
```
npm i @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env
```

The next is to start to use some code that has classes and other ES6 specialities. I used the four following files to try some things out. Any code will need to be added to _src_ folder

_rectangle.js_
```
export class Rectangle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }

  area(){
    return this.height * this.width;
  }

  perimeter(){
    return this.height * 2 + this.width * 2;
  }
}
```

_rectangles.js_
```
import {Rectangle} from "./rectangle";
export class Rectangles{
  constructor(){
    this._rectangles = [];
  }

  add(rectangle) {
    this._rectangles.push(rectangle)
  }

  totalPerimeter() {
    let perimeter = 0;
    this._rectangles.forEach(function(rectangle){
      perimeter += rectangle.perimeter();
    });
    return perimeter;
  }

  totalArea() {
    let area = 0;
    this._rectangles.forEach(function(rectangle){
      area += rectangle.area();
    });
    return area;
  }
}
```

_index.js_
```
import {Rectangles} from "./rectangles";
import {Rectangle} from "./rectangle";

let rectangles = new Rectangles();

rectangles.add(new Rectangle(1, 1));

console.log(rectangles.totalPerimeter());
console.log(rectangles.totalArea());


rectangles.add(new Rectangle(2, 2));
console.log(rectangles.totalPerimeter());
console.log(rectangles.totalArea());
```

_index.html_
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>How to set up Webpack, and Babel</title>
</head>

<body>
    <div id="wrapper">
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```


Now we can produce our code and have it bundled together. Want to have Webpack produce a HTML page with all the JS bundled together.
We will need two dependencies: html-webpack-plugin & html-loader
```
npm i html-webpack-plugin html-loader --save-dev
```


Finally, need to update the _webpack.config.js_
```
const HtmlWebPackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
 module: {
   rules: [
     {
       test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
       exclude: /node_modules/,
       use: {
         loader: "babel-loader"
       }
     },
     {
       test: /\.html$/,
       use: [
         {
           loader: "html-loader"
         }
       ]
     }
   ]
 },
 plugins: [
   new HtmlWebPackPlugin({
     template: "./src/index.html",
     filename: "./index.html"
   })
 ]
};

Now running `npm run build` will result in a _dist_ folder being created with an _index.html_ and a _main.js_. This index.html can be opened up in any browser and should display some text. The ES6 classes will be compiled to something supported by IE.


##Automatic Code Builds/Refresh
A development server can be used so that when you make a change to the file you do not need to do another build. To setup we need a _webpack-dev-server_
```
npm i webpack-dev-server --save-dev
```

Now just to need to the scripts of _package.json_ the following line:
```
"scripts": {
 "start": "webpack-dev-server --open --mode development",
 "build": "webpack --mode production"
}

Now running the command `npm start` will open up a webpage in your browser. Whenever you edit a file it will change the webpage in the browser.
```
